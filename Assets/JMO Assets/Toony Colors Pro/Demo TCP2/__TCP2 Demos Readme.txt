You will find multiple unitypackages files corresponding to demos of various features from Toony Colors Pro 2.
They are made for either:
- the Built-In Render Pipeline (BIRP)
- the Universal Render Pipeline (URP)

The "Demo TCP2 Hybrid Shader" scene works with both render pipelines.

Here is a summary of the other demos contained in each package:

- "_Cat Demo BIRP/URP": a scene showing various visual styles possible using shaders generated through the Shader Generator 2, along with a cartoon water shader example and vertex colors-based texture blending
- "_Material Layers Demo BIRP/URP": a scene showing examples of the 'Material Layers' feature from the Shader Generator 2, with which you can easily add layers in your materials (snow, grass, dust, player colors, etc.)
- "_Shader Generator 2 Demo BIRP": a scene showing advanced shaders made with the Shader Generator 2 (some of those are detailed in the tutorials section of the documentation)
- "_Legacy Demos BIRP": two scenes, one with example shaders of the old Shader Generator 1, and one with a showcase of the stylized "Standard PBS" shader
